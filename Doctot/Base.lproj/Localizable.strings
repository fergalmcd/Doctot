The items include feeding, moving from wheelchair to bed and return, grooming, transferring to and from a toilet, bathing, walking on level surface, going up and down stairs, dressing, continence of bowels and bladder.<BR>
<BR>
The assessment can be used to determine a baseline level of functioning and can be used to monitor improvement in activities of daily living over time. The items are weighted according to a scheme developed by the authors. The person receives a score based on whether they have received help while doing the task. The scores for each of the items are summed to create a total score. The higher the score the more 'independent' the person. Independence means that the person needs no assistance at any part of the task. If a persons does about 50% independently then the 'middle' score would apply.<BR>
<BR>
GUIDELINES:<BR>
<BR>
1.    The index should be used as a record of what a patient does, not as a record of what a patient could do.<BR>
2.    The main aim is to establish degree of independence from any help, physical or verbal, however minor and for whatever reason.<BR>
3.    The need for supervision renders the patient not independent.<BR>
4.    Patient performance should be established using the best available evidence. Asking the patient, friends/relatives and nurses are the usual sources, but direct observation and common sense are also important. However direct testing is not needed.<BR>
5.    Usually patient performance over the preceding 24-48 hours is important, but occasionally longer periods will be relevant.<BR>
6.    Middle categories imply that the patient supplies over 50 per cent of the effort.<BR>
7.    Use of aids to be independent is allowed.";

The Early Clinical Drug Evaluation Program (ECDEU) version of the CGI (reproduced here) is the most widely used format, and asks that the clinician rate the patient relative to their past experience with other patients with the same diagnosis, with or without collateral information. Several alternative versions of the CGI have been developed, however, such as the FDA Clinicians’ Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC), which uses only information collected during the interview, not collateral. The CGI has proved to be a robust measure of efficacy in many clinical drug trials, and is easy and quick to administer, provided that the clinician knows the patient well.";

Treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacy and treatment-related adverse events and range from 0 (marked improvement and no side-effects) and 4 (unchanged or worse and side-effects outweigh the therapeutic effects).

The other is based on the individual patient’s history of exacerbations, with two or more exacerbations in the preceding year indicating high risk. (If there is a discrepancy between the risk category as assessed by spirometric classification and that derived from exacerbation history, the assessment pointing to the highest risk should be used.)<BR>

In the emergency setting, frequent retaking of this assessment is important initially and after interventions.

Treatment should change in step with a new score. Clinical judgement is required in this matter.
